#Mobile Flashcard

## Description

This is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).


## Installation

### `npm install`

You shall install all Dependency by running `npm install`. All dependency in `package.json` shall be installed.

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

### Testing environment.
This App is test with IOS simulator, and an android phone.
